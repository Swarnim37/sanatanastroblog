Recently, Indian-born British-American novelist Salman Rushdie was attacked by a man who rushed up onto the stage and stabbed him repeatedly, including in the neck. The attacker was pulled away before being taken into custody; Rushdie was airlifted to a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he underwent surgery.

Rushdie's agent, Andrew Wylie, said: "Salman will likely lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed, and his liver was stabbed and damaged." Wylie said Rushdie is currently on a ventilator and unable to speak.

Let’s have a look if he has a combination for an attack like such. The body is represented by the 1st house, and the 1st lord is strongly placed in its own sign aspected by the 9th lord and prime benefic Jupiter. Overall ascendant has a lot of vitality. So,
where is the problem?

- Despite being the 1st lord, Mars is not completely benefic for Aries ascendant as it rules the 8th house as well.

- Mars itself is the 8th lord of sudden injury, accidents, and events.

- Mars denotes violence, blood, surgery, and sharp objects.

- Kritika Nakshatra symbolizes knives and sharp objects, and Mars, the planet of violence, is in that Nakshatra.

- The aspect of Saturn on the ascendent and its lord is adding further maleficence. Mars is also aspecting Saturn back.

#### Why did it happen?

- He is currently running Ketu-Rahu-Mercury.

- Ketu is in the 8th house in the 8th sign of Scorpio, furthermore aspected by 8th lord that too is Mars. Ketu is placed 6th of conflicts and health from the Moon, not helping either.

#### Why Rahu?

- Rahu is placed in the 2nd house and signs Taurus of the face, eyes, the upper part of the neck, and throat. Not only that, it’s also afflicting the 2nd lord Venus. From the Moon, this combination falls 12th, and 12th house shows hospitalization.

- Mercury is not a benefic as it rules the 6th house, a dusthana (evil house). 6th house stands for health, enemy, struggle, etc.

#### What triggered the event?

- Ketu- Rahu are transiting on the 1-7 axis. Antardasha lord (sub-period) Rahu is transiting the 1st house and near to the 1st lord Mars.

- Mars recently entered Taurus and the 2nd house. Moreover, it transits over natal Rahu and Venus but also aspects the 8th house and mahadasha (major period) lord Ketu.

- Jupiter and Saturn both are retrograde and influence the 12th house of hospitalization.

- From Moon, Saturn is transiting the 8th house (Asthama Shani) and from there, its aspects the natal Saturn and 2nd house.

It looks like a very delicate time for Mr. Rushdie. Let’s hope and pray for his speedy recovery.
